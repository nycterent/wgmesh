# User setup
# Note: wgmesh performs privileged networking operations (e.g., WireGuard
# interface management, route updates) that require NET_ADMIN and related
# capabilities. To ensure these operations succeed, the container runs as
# root by default. The wgmesh user/group are created for optional use if
# you want to run non-privileged operations with explicit capability grants.
